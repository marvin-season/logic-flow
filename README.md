# React + Ts + Tailwind

## what is this

**A tool to handle your data using custom nodes created with react-workflow.**

There are some basic nodes like `condition`, `loop`, and so on, similar to functional programming languages.

Condition nodes are like if-else statements, and loop nodes are like for-while loops.

Finally, you can compose your nodes to create a custom func flow, these flow can be saved as a New Node, and you can use
it in other flows.

In conclusion, it's a tool composed of many nodes, and each node is similar to a concept in programming languages or a
custom node.
